# Companies House Digger

Companies House Digger is a Flask-based web application for mining and visualizing company data from the UKâ€™s Companies House. It supports CRUD operations for companies, persons, and their relationships, as well as an interactive network visualization using Vis.js.

## Features

- **Companies & Persons Management:**  
  Create, read, update, and delete companies and persons, with details such as company number, registered address, status, and incorporation date.

- **Relationships & Attributes:**  
  Define relationships (e.g., directorship, shareholding) between companies and persons. Relationships can include extra attributes (e.g., number of shares) stored in a separate attributes table.

- **Network Visualization:**  
  View an interactive network map of companies and persons. The network supports:
  - **Focus Mode:** Filter the network by focusing on a specific company with adjustable depth.
  - **Relationship Type Filtering:** Use checkboxes to hide or show certain relationship types.
  - **Directional Edges:** Visualize the direction of relationships with arrows on the edges.
